## 📖 Overview
Hakilix Core is a decentralized, neuromorphic Edge AI platform designed to bridge the gap between independent living and clinical oversight. By fusing **4D mmWave Radar** with **Radiometric Thermal** sensing, the system creates a privacy-preserving "Digital Twin" of the resident, allowing for the detection of micro-degradations in mobility (Predictive Reablement) without the use of invasive cameras.

## 🚀 Key Features (v4.5 Platinum)
* **Neuromorphic Edge Inference:** Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) models running on low-power edge TPUs.
* **Privacy-by-Design:** No optical cameras. No raw data leaves the home; only encrypted telemetry.
* **NHS Home-Bridge Engine:** Interoperability layer converting sensor data to FHIR standards for Virtual Ward integration.
* **Care Command Center:** Real-time agency dashboard for fleet management and risk triage.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
* **Frontend:** HTML5, Tailwind CSS, Three.js (Holographic Visualization)
* **Backend Simulation:** Python (Mock), FHIR JSON Structure
* **Edge Logic:** Spiking Neural Networks (SNN), Active Inference
